# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 11, 2024**

## Introduction

Cooldown ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mindfulness and meditation application.

## Information We Collect

Cooldown operates as an offline-first application with optional cloud features. We collect:

- **Usage Data:** Session history, breathing exercise preferences, calm scores, streaks, and achievements stored locally on your device
- **Settings & Preferences:** App settings, notification preferences, and customization choices
- **Google Account Information:** If you connect your Google account, we collect your email address, Google account ID, and Firebase UID for authentication and cloud sync
- **Custom Username:** If you set a custom username for leaderboards, this is stored both locally and in our cloud database
- **Cloud Sync Data:** Your user profile (email, username, activity status) is synced to Firebase Firestore for cross-device access when connected with Google
- **Leaderboard Data:** Your leaderboard entries (user ID, username, calm score, streak, total sessions) are stored for global rankings
- **Widget Data:** If you use our home screen widget, your calm score, streak, and progress are shared with the widget for display
- **Advertising Data:** Google Mobile Ads may collect advertising identifiers and usage data for ad targeting (premium users do not see ads)
- **Anonymous Analytics:** We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve the app experience

## How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used to:

- Provide and maintain the app's core functionality
- Track your progress, streaks, and achievements
- Sync your data across devices when you connect with Google
- Display your username and rankings on global leaderboards
- Deliver personalized notifications and reminders
- Update your home screen widget with current progress
- Display relevant advertisements to non-premium users
- Improve app performance and user experience
- Provide customer support

## Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored both locally on your device and, if you connect with Google, in Google's Firebase Firestore cloud database.

**Security Measures:**
- Local data is stored securely on your device using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms
- Cloud data is protected by Firebase security rules ensuring users can only access and modify their own data
- Data transmitted between your device and Firebase servers is encrypted in transit using industry-standard SSL/TLS protocols
- Google Sign-In provides secure authentication using OAuth 2.0 standards
- Firestore security rules restrict data access based on authentication status and user identity

No method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Services

Cooldown integrates with the following third-party services:

- **Google Sign-In:** Used for authentication and account management (Google Privacy Policy)
- **Firebase Authentication:** Manages user authentication sessions (Google Privacy Policy)
- **Cloud Firestore:** Stores user profiles and leaderboard data in the cloud (Google Privacy Policy)
- **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):** Displays advertisements to non-premium users and may collect advertising identifiers
- **In-App Purchases:** Handled by Apple App Store or Google Play Store
- **Home Widget:** Widget data is stored locally on your device
- **Notification Services:** Local notifications handled by your device's operating system

We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access your data stored locally on your device
- View your cloud-synced data through the app when connected with Google
- Disconnect your Google account at any time through app settings

- Opt-out of personalized ads through your device settings
- Opt-out of notifications in the app settings
- Choose not to use cloud features by not connecting a Google account

**Note:** When you disconnect your Google account, your cloud profile is marked as inactive but not immediately deleted. Leaderboard data may remain visible until it naturally expires from the rankings.

## Data Sharing and Public Information

**Public Information:**
- Your chosen **username** is publicly visible on global leaderboards
- Your **calm score, streak, and total sessions** are visible on leaderboards when you participate

**What We Don't Share:**

- Data is only shared with third-party services listed above as necessary to provide app functionality

## Children's Privacy

Cooldown is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Policy
